# First .md type file.
Just fiddling with the markdown format to see how **bold** and *italic* and headings work.
From here on I will keep track of the first few commands and utilities that I use when I start with git.
###### 1.) cd
cd stands for change directory, pretty self-explanatory.
###### 2.) mkdir
mkdir stands for make directory.
###### 3.) git clone 
cloning a remote repository to your local machine.
###### 4.) git push
pushing the changes back to the remote repository.
Enough for the first Readme.
A little change for the sake of branching.
